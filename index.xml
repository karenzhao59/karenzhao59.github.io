      <description>We learned Python in addition to R at the end of our computational biology course. One of my favorite things that we learned is the use of Pandas. Pandas is used for data manipulation and data wrangling. See:
import pandas as pd import numpy as np cw=pd.read_csv(&amp;quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selva86/datasets/master/ChickWeight.csv&amp;quot;, index_col=0) print(cw.head()) ## Time Chick Diet ## weight ## 42 0 1 1 ## 51 4 1 1 ## 59 8 1 1 ## 64 12 1 1 ## 76 16 1 1 A cool function in Pandas is describe, which gives some numerical evaluations of the variables in the dataset, including minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation.</description>

      <description>0. Introduction (5 pts) I chose to focus on amusement parks, specifically the injuries sustained by amusement park goers, for my project simply because I have always loved going to amusement parks. However, I never gave much thought to just how dangerous the rides were and how many people actually sustained severe injuries from them. The dataset I chose was provided by RPubs, and it provides a variety of details about the injuries sustained by amusement park goers at different amusement parks in Texas.</description>

      <description>Modeling Instructions A knitted R Markdown document (preferably HTML) and the raw R Markdown file (as .Rmd) should both be submitted to Canvas by 11:59pm on the due date. These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., donâ€™t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document). In the .Rmd file for Project 2, you can copy the first code-chunk into your project .</description>
