We learned Python in addition to R at the end of our computational biology course. One of my favorite things that we learned is the use of Pandas. Pandas is used for data manipulation and data wrangling. See:

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np 
cw=pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selva86/datasets/master/ChickWeight.csv", index_col=0)
print(cw.head())
```
A cool function in Pandas is describe, which gives some numerical evaluations of the variables in the dataset, including minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation. 
See:

```{python}
print(cw.describe())
```
